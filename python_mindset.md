1. **Watch Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset{:target="_blank"} (10.5 minutes)**

- Power of “not yet” vs tyranny of “now”   
- When faced with challenge - those that have fixed mindset will likely run away from the problem or feel debilitated by it.
- However, those with the growth mindset, realize that they can face the next challenge

- Praise wisely -
Don’t praise intelligence ie don’t praise outcomes.
But praise process - focus, perseverance, ability to keep trying, effort, strategy and progress

- Grit 
is engaging in your passion and perseverance while focusing on the long term goals rather than immediate results. 

- Ability to learn and grow in the face of challenge is growth mindset because it is belief that learning does not end with failing.

3. **Alain de Botton on Redefining Success:**

- https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success

- **Why are we victims of career crises?**  
- Because of “job snobbery”- we see people bestow “love” and affection respect and attachment because of their status in the social hierarchy.    
- Stress is due to false feeling of equality when we are actually not equal and that causes envy.  We are less likely to feel envious of someone who is different than us than when we are next to people similar to us.  
- Success - you can’t be successful at everything.  You will always lose out in something.  And ideas of what we are successful is not our own but taken from movies, videos, and society.  We should focus on our successes by focusing introspectively about what we want for ourselves.   

4. **Listen to The Drs. Sarah on Impostor Syndrome - Pt 1**

- Despite all that you have accomplished objectively, we are able to dismiss it in correlation to the false negative narrative in our head.  
- Loneliness or feeling as an “outsider” it feeds into the imposter syndrome and it can be debilitating.
When the perception for that role is that you have to be intrinsically brilliant, then there was likely to see “white male” in that field only and tend to push away those that are not dominant communities- like women, non-white etc.   
- Journal writing is one way to throw off the imposter syndrome. Also try focusing on other hobbies or relationships.   
- Lastly, think about meditation and breathing exercises to calm yourself when you feel the negative thoughts emerge.

- Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)

- Nice to hear that being busy is not a goal but a symptom of something wrong.  Being focussed and prioritizing is an art that is important to develop if you want to be successful.  For example, for world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters. Really successful people say no to most things, because most things won’t get them to where they truly want to be.

- There were many aspects that resonated with me -    
a) everyone learns differently and that we all bring our different skillset to the table.   
b) Asking questions is important in investing in your own future  
c) Money and time are valuable but it doesn’t mean you cannot do what you enjoy  
d) Failing and learning from others’ failures is also important.
